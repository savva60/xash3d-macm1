Hey Gordon

A terrorist planted a bomb somewhere here in the powerplant. 
He wired the bomb with a remote triggered timer.

If you step in to this laser barrier, the timer will start. 
It last's you 60 seconds until the bomb explodes.

Your only chance to defuse the bomb, is to walk through the lasers, 
then you have 60 seconds to find the bomb and disable it.

Good luck!

HINT: Everytime you load the map new, the bomb will spawn on an other spot.
}

HC2_BOMB3
{
Bad news, sir!

This damn terrorist planted an other bomb, short time ago.
We need you again for searching and defusing this bomb, Gordon!

Good luck!

HINT: Maybe you have to wait until the clock is ready again.
}

HC2_BOMB2
{
Thanks for finding that bomb! We're still searching for this terrorist.
I hope, he won't plant an other bomb until you're back.

HC2_LOG1
{
Log entry found:

After several of the archeologists gone crazy while studying 
the foreign object we found in a exploratory tunnel, we sealed 
that damn thing, and hope nobody else will open it again.

Sadly, the rails of the lorry train are therefore interrupted, 
and the train remains in its repair bay for an indefinite period of time.
}

HC2_LOG2
{
Log entry found:

This negligent mechanic left a maintenance cowling open on 
the secondary stone crusher. But he didn't even found the crowbar, 
that one of our own fools accidentally dropped into the driving mechanism.
He said, it fell right to the bottom. 

Hopefully he's right, we can't afford to stop the whole equiptment again,
and it's still running fine, so I don't expect it took damage.
}

HC2_LOG3
{
Log entry found:

The rift underneath the second stone crusher was sealed. But reportedly, 
they used the wrong concrete, and there are already new cracks, 
near where the conveyor leaves for the loading area.

Maybe it's better to break it up again, because I miss my yellow keycard
since then. And some other equiptment. Damn fools!
}

HC2_LOG4
{
Log entry found:

Thanks to this bloody bureaucrats of the safety office, now we have to 
store all our blasting means in separate places, spread all over the 
facility! Getting the dynamite from the explosives storage, the blasting 
cable from the maintenance office and the timer and key from the 
storage at the freight management offices will already take hours for a 
single blast.

Hopefully, Jack has finished repairing the blasting machine. I don't like
sensible equiptment like this near the main TBM.
}

HC2_LOG5
{
Log entry found:

Carter this idiot! He's in responsibility of the surface ventilation access.
And now he's going for a hunt for this foreign object in the sealed 
exploratory tunnel.

If he gets lost, carrying the only key for the ventilation access, 
we have to order a new key! Am I surrounded by idiots?
}

HC2_LOG6
{
Log entry found:

An other absolutley useless safety installation is this fence over the main 
melt pool in the factory. Besides it's useless, we can't even access 
the maintenance area below now.

The firedoor controls at the freight management offices are broken, so 
in case that the firedoor is triggered somehow, we can't even open it 
without somebody crawling into the maintenace area to activate the override!
}

HC2_LOG7
{
Log entry found:

These fools drilled one of the exploratory tunnels near the TBM into 
the repair bay! That's an other gift for the safety inspectors!

We shut this tunnel with some planks. I hope it's sufficient for now.
